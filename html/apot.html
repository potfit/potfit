<h1>Analytic Potentials</h1>

<p>
Analytic pair potentials can be enabled in <em>potfit</em> by compiling it with
the apot switch. There are some additional options for analytic potentials like the 
chemical potentials or the smooth cutoff.
</p>

<h2><a id="chempot" name="chempot">
Chemical Potentials</a></h2>
<p>
For fitting simple pair potentials the use of the chemical potentials will always be
enabled unless the <b>disable_cp</b> switch in the configuration file is set to 1.<br>
This option effectively adds another energy term into the calculations, the energy
will be calculated as <br /><img src="chempot.png" alt="E_tot=\sum_{species}\mu_iN_i+\sum_{pairs}V(r)"><br>
With this feature enabled, the potential file has to be altered, an additional block
has to be added right after the header.</p>
<pre>
#F 0 3
#C Mg Zn
#I 0 0 0
#E

cp_Mg -1 -10 0
cp_Zn -1 -10 0
</pre>
<p>There has to be one line per element, starting with cp_, the rest of the name 
will be replaced by the element name (if the #C line is available) or the element number.<br>
The following three values are the starting value, the minimum and maximum for that parameter.<br>
<br>
For EAM-potentials this option is not available and lines beginning with cp_ will be ignored.
</p>

<h2><a id="sc" name="sc">
Smooth Cutoff</a></h2>
<p>
The smooth cutoff function is very important for analytic potentials since it ensures that the
potential and its gradient vanish at the desired cutoff radius.<br />
Therefor the potential is replaced by a cubic polynomial at a certain range.<br />
To enable the smooth cutoff for a potential, _sc has to be added to the potential identifier.</p>
<pre>
type lj_sc
cutoff 7
...
</pre>
<p>Potentials fitted with the _sc option will have an additional line in the output potential.</p>
<pre>
type eopp_sc
cutoff 7.000000
# rmin 2.199710
# r_0=5.950000 a_0=-0.001038 a_1=0.020511 a_2=-0.134513 a_3=0.292712
...
</pre>
<p>This line indicates, that the cutoff function was applied at a range of 5.95 and the cubic
polynomial was a_0*r^3+a_1*r^2+a_2*r+a_3.
</p>
