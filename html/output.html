<h1>Standard Output</h1>
<p><em>potfit</em> prints information on the minimization progress to
stdout. Additionally all input and output files used are also written
to standard output. The output will also be written to standard output unless
the <a href="params.html"><tt>output_prefix</tt> parameter</a> is set. <br />
After optimizing the potential, the local
densities (eam only) are printed, followed by the terms in the sum of
squares. The latter consist of a number identifying either atom or
configuration, then the contribution to the sum of squares, the value
calculated from the potential, the reference value and finally the
relative deviation of calculated and reference value.</p>


<h1>Potfit Output Files</h1>

<h2><a id="endpot" name="endpot">Final potential</a></h2>

<p>
<em>potfit</em> naturally writes the potential achieved in
minimization to a file using the same format as for the input
potential. The name of this file is specified by the <a
href="params.html"><tt>endpot</tt> parameter</a>.
</p>

<h2><a id="temp" name="temp">Temporary Potential File</a></h2>
<p> Every now and then (after restart of Powell algorithm or step
adjustment of simulated annealing) an intermediate potential is
written to <a href="params.html"><tt>tempfile</tt></a>.
</p>

<h2><a id="imd" name="imd">IMD Potential File</a></h2>
<p>Prefix of files to which the <a
href="http://www.itap.physik.uni-stuttgart.de/~imd/">IMD</a> potential
data are written. The suffixes used are self-explanatory, the number
of steps in each potential is given by the <a
href="params.html"><tt>imdsteps</tt> parameter</a></p>

<h2><a id="plot" name="plot"></a>Plotting files</h2>
<p>Two files are printed to use with gnuplot: The <tt>plotpointfile</tt> 
contains the sampling points in gnuplot-readable form, whereas the
<tt>plotfile</tt> uses spline-interpolated points to draw continuous
curves of the potential functions. As <em>potfit</em> uses spline
interpolation internally, the plotted functions are an accurate
representation of the potentials used.
</p>

<h2><a id="output" name="output"></a>Output files</h2>
<p>
If the <a href="params.html"><tt>output_prefix</tt> parameter</a> is set in the
configuration file, <em>potfit</em> will write several files, else all information
will be printed to standard output.<br />
In detail the files written are:<br /></p>
<table summary="Overview of the output files written by potfit">
	<tr>
		<td width=150>.force</td>
		<td>contains the calculated and reference forces</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>.energy</td>
		<td>contains the calculated and reference energies</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>.stress</td>
		<td>contains the calculated and reference stresses</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>.punish</td>
		<td>contains the different punishments</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>.rho_loc</td>
		<td>local electron density</td>
	</tr>
</table><br />
<p>
All these files contain header lines, describing the following data.
