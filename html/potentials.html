<h1>Interactions</h1>

<p>
<em>potfit</em> supports various short range
effective potentials. These potentials are defined by tabulated
functions read from a <a href="potformat.html">potential file</a>.
The potentials supported are <a href="pairpot.html">central pair
potentials</a>, and
<a href="eam2.html">Embedded Atom Method (EAM)</a> potentials for 
metals.

<p>
Since the computation of the forces is the most time-critical part
of a molecular dynamics simulation, support for each type of
interaction has to be enabled explicitly by a compilation option.
If no interaction type is specified, central pair potentials
are assumed by default. 

<!-- Different interaction types can be -->
<!-- combined with each other, by enabling more than one type -->
<!-- of interaction. Their contributions are then just added. This is  -->
<!-- still somewhat experimental, and there are some restrictions. -->
<!-- Here are some guidelines: -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!-- <li>At most <b>one</b> of the <a href="covalent.html">covalent   -->
<!--     potentials</a> can be used at a time.</li> -->
<!-- <li><a href="pairpot.html">Central pair potentials</a>,  -->
<!--     <a href="eam2.html">EAM potentials</a>, and one of  -->
<!--     <a href="covalent.html#tersoff">Tersoff</a> or -->
<!--     <a href="covalent.html#ttbp">tabulated Stillinger-Weber -->
<!--     potentials</a> <b>can be combined</b> with each other.  -->
<!--     The central pair potential part contained in these interactions  -->
<!--     (except in <a href="covalent.html#tersoff">Tersoff</a> potentials)  -->
<!--     is <b>shared</b>.</li> -->
<!-- <li>The option <b>pair</b> can be used to enable a (short range) -->
<!--     <a href="pairpot.html">pair potential</a> part together with  -->
<!--     <a href="ewald.html">Coulomb</a> or <a href="covalent.html#tersoff"> -->
<!--     Tersoff</a> potentials. -->
<!--     The same option is also used to enable the harmonic potential -->
<!--     used for the <a href="ewald.html#shell">shell model</a> in  -->
<!--     combination with <a href="ewald.html">Coulomb interactions</a>.</li>  -->
<!-- <li><a href="ewald.html">Coulomb potentials</a> can be combined with  -->
<!--     everything else, whether or not this makes sense.</li> -->
