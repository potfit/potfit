<p><em>potfit</em> was originally developed by <a href="http://www.itap.physik.uni-stuttgart.de/~pbro/index.html">Peter Brommer</a> during
his <a

thesis</a> and <a
href="http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/opus/volltexte/2008/3410/">doctoral thesis</a> work. </p>

<p>
The development of <em>potfit</em> is continued by Peter Brommer as
part of his PhD thesis work. This work was funded through the DFG,
